## Connecting to local node
You can use Portal to connect to your [local zkSync Era node](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/).

Prerequisites: Node.js version 16+, npm version 7+

1. Follow the [documentation](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/) to set up either **in-memory node** or **dockerized local setup**.
2. Clone Portal repository and install the dependencies
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal.git
    cd dapp-portal
    npm install
    ```
3. In case network ID, RPC URL or other information differs from the default values, edit them in `data/networks.ts` file. You can also customize the list of displayed tokens there.
    - You can also use the [configuration form](./hyperchains/README.md#configure-automatically-with-form) to generate the config file with simple prompts.
4. Run the development server:
    - For in-memory node:
      ```bash
      npm run dev:node:memory
      ```
    - For dockerized local setup:
      ```bash
      npm run dev:node:docker
      ```
  Check the console output to find started Portal URL and open it in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000)
